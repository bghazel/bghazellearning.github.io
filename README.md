# Ben Hazel's Learning Repository

This is my github Repository where I am learning powershell and other tools to further my IT Career. In this read me will be a log of my goals.

# Progress Log

8/25/25 - The current longterm goal is to understand powershell at a basic level in order to automate more of the tasks I repeatedly do. First project to bang my head aginst is to run DISM and SFC scans through a .ps1 script. Not the most usefull but should hopefully help me get the basics of how to call a command like that
<br>    - I reorganized my GitHub Repo and seperated out the old files into folders. Setup github remote repo on VSCode and installed all my needed extensions.
