# Ben Hazel's Learning Repository

This is my github Repository where I am learning powershell and other tools to further my IT Career. In this read me will be a log of my goals.

# Progress Log

8/25/25 - The first longterm goal I'd like to set is to understand powershell at a basic level and gain the ability to automate more of the tasks I repeatedly do. First project to bang my head aginst is to run DISM and SFC scans through a .ps1 script. Not the most usefull but should hopefully help me get the basics of how to call a command like that
<br>    - I reorganized my GitHub Repo and seperated out the old files into folders. Setup github remote repo on VSCode and installed all my needed extensions. Got the PS extension working on work computer through threatlocker in a safe manner by adding an exclusion that had the conditions that it was in a specific folder and created by my VSCode client. Got aproval of manager.
<br>    -created a quick hello world script to test.
